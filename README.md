# iherb-cli

A Rust command-line tool for querying product data from [iHerb](https://www.iherb.com). Designed for both AI agents and humans — clean commands, Markdown output, no API key required.

iHerb has no official API. This CLI uses a headless browser to load pages (bypassing Cloudflare), extracts structured data, and presents it in a consistent, parseable format.

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeverinAlexB/iherb-cli/master/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads the latest release binary for your platform and installs it to `/usr/local/bin`. Run the same command again to update.

### Build from source

Requires [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (1.70+).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SeverinAlexB/iherb-cli.git
cd iherb-cli
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be at `target/release/iherb-cli`.

### Browser

iherb-cli needs a Chromium-based browser. It resolves one automatically:

1. User-configured path (`IHERB_BROWSER_PATH` env var or config file)
2. System-installed Chrome/Chromium (auto-detected)
3. Auto-downloads [Chrome for Testing](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) on first run

## Usage

```
iherb-cli <command> [options] [arguments]
```

### Search for products

```bash
iherb-cli search "vitamin c"
iherb-cli search "omega 3" --limit 20 --sort price-asc
iherb-cli search "protein" --category supplements --sort best-selling
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--limit <n>` | Max results to return (paginates automatically) | 20 |
| `--sort <method>` | `relevance`, `price-asc`, `price-desc`, `rating`, `best-selling` | `relevance` |
| `--category <slug>` | Filter by category (e.g., `supplements`, `vitamins`) | — |

**Example output:**

```markdown
## Search results for "vitamin c" (showing 3 of 1,200+)

### Global flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--country <code>` | Country code for localized pricing (e.g., `us`, `ch`, `de`) | `us` |
| `--currency <code>` | Currency code (e.g., `USD`, `CHF`, `EUR`) | `USD` |
| `--no-cache` | Bypass local cache and fetch fresh data | — |
| `--delay <ms>` | Delay between requests in milliseconds | `2000` |
| `--debug` | Run browser in headed (visible) mode | — |

```bash
# Swiss storefront with CHF pricing
iherb-cli search "magnesium" --country ch --currency CHF

# Fast mode (shorter delay between requests)
iherb-cli search "zinc" --delay 500

# Debug with visible browser
iherb-cli product 61864 --debug
```

## Configuration

Settings are resolved in order of priority:

1. CLI flags (highest)
2. Environment variables (`IHERB_BROWSER_PATH`, `IHERB_COUNTRY`, `IHERB_CURRENCY`)
3. Config file
4. Defaults

### Config file

Location: `~/.config/iherb-cli/config.toml`

```toml
[defaults]
country = "ch"
currency = "CHF"
```

## Caching

Scraped data is cached locally to reduce redundant requests. The cache directory is platform-dependent:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Caches/iherb-cli/`
- **Linux:** `~/.cache/iherb-cli/`

All cached data expires after **30 days**.

Every result includes a `Data from:` timestamp so you know how fresh the data is. Use `--no-cache` to bypass the cache and fetch fresh data.

## How it works

iHerb uses Cloudflare anti-bot protection, so simple HTTP requests are blocked. iherb-cli uses a headless Chromium browser (via the Chrome DevTools Protocol) to load pages like a real user.

**Data extraction** for a product page uses three strategies with automatic
fallback:

1. **JSON-LD** structured data embedded in the page — this is the one that
   fires today, on every page we have looked at
2. **JavaScript globals** (`window.IHR_DL.product`, `window.PRODUCT_DETAILS`)
3. **DOM scraping** — CSS selector-based extraction as a last resort

Whichever wins, the result is then enriched from the DOM, so the fields you get
do not depend on which strategy got there first.

A search page has one strategy: read the product cards out of the DOM.

**Every field records where it came from** — JSON-LD, JS globals, the DOM, or
absent, meaning every strategy ran and none produced it. That distinction is
why the tool can tell "iHerb publishes no shipping weight for this item" from
"our selector rotted": both used to be an empty field and nothing could tell
them apart. `--debug` prints the whole provenance table alongside the product,
and a record missing something every product page publishes prints a
`Data quality: degraded` line whether you asked for it or not.

For the same reason, a page that loads and yields nothing is reported as a
failed extraction rather than a missing product. The first means "retry is
reasonable and a human should look at the selectors"; the second means "stop
asking about this id". Reporting the first as the second is the worst available
answer, and it is what the tool used to do.

There used to be a fourth product rung, `__NEXT_DATA__`. iHerb does not serve
that blob — not on any of the seven captured pages, and not on pages fetched
live in August 2026 — so it was never a fallback, only the appearance of one.
It is deleted rather than left in place, because an advertised fallback that has
never fired is worse than an honest shorter chain.

## Claude Code skill

This repo includes a [Claude Code skill](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) that teaches AI agents how to use `iherb-cli` for supplement research. With the skill installed, Claude can autonomously search for products, compare ingredients, and make recommendations.

### Install the skill

```bash
/install-plugin iherb-agent@SeverinAlexB/iherb-cli
```

### What the agent can do

Once installed, Claude can handle requests like:

- *"What's the best-rated vitamin D3 on iHerb?"*
- *"Compare the top 3 magnesium glycinate supplements by price and dosage"*
- *"What are the ingredients in iHerb product 61864?"*
- *"Find me a budget omega-3 supplement with good reviews"*

The skill guides Claude through multi-step workflows — searching, fetching details, comparing nutrition facts, and recommending products with reasoning.

### Requirements

The `iherb-cli` binary must be available on `PATH`. Build it first:

```bash
cargo build --release
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/target/release"
```

## Supported countries

45+ country codes including: `us`, `ca`, `au`, `nz`, `gb`, `de`, `fr`, `ch`, `at`, `it`, `es`, `nl`, `be`, `se`, `no`, `dk`, `fi`, `jp`, `kr`, `cn`, `tw`, `hk`, `sg`, `my`, `th`, `in`, `ae`, `sa`, `il`, `br`, `mx`, `cl`, `co`, `ar`, and more.
