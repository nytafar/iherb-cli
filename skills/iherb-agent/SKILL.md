# iherb-agent

Use the `iherb-cli` binary to query iHerb product data. It uses a headless browser (first run may take a moment to download Chrome). Results are cached for 30 days. Every result includes a `Data from:` timestamp — use `--no-cache` if the data is stale.

## Commands

### Search

```bash
iherb-cli search "<query>" [--limit <n>] [--sort <method>] [--category <slug>]
```

- `--limit`: max distinct products (default 20). iHerb repeats some products in a
  results grid; each is returned once, so N results means N different products.
  A run that comes up short says whether iHerb ran out of results or the walk did.
- `--sort`: `relevance` (default), `featured`, `best-selling`, `rating`, `most-rated`,
  `price-asc`, `price-desc`, `newest`, `highest-discount`. `relevance` is iHerb's
  ranking for the query; `featured` is its merchandised order, which is what the
  site shows when no sort is asked for. `most-rated` orders by number of reviews,
  which is usually what "well established" means — `rating` surfaces 5.0/5
  products with three reviews.
- `--category`: filter by category name (e.g. `supplements`, `vitamins`, `protein`,
  `herbs`, `minerals`, `sports`) or by a numeric iHerb category id (e.g. `1855`).
  A name the CLI does not know is an error and the message lists the ones it does,
  so a filter is never silently dropped.

Output: Markdown list with name, brand, price, rating, review count, product ID, URL.

### Product details

```bash
iherb-cli product <id-or-url> [--section <name>]
```

Accepts a numeric product ID (e.g., `61864`) or full URL.

`--section` options: `overview`, `description`, `ingredients`, `nutrition`, `suggested-use`, `warnings`, `reviews`

Output: Full Markdown with overview, supplement facts table, ingredients, suggested use, warnings, review distribution.

### Global flags

- `--country <code>`: localized storefront (e.g., `ch`, `de`, `jp`). Default: `us`
- `--currency <code>`: currency (e.g., `CHF`, `EUR`). Default: `USD`
- `--no-cache`: bypass cache
- `--debug`: show browser window

## Workflows

### Find the best product for a need

1. Search with `--sort best-selling` or `--sort rating` to find top options
2. Get details on 2-3 top candidates: `iherb-cli product <id>`
3. Compare ingredients, dosage, price-per-serving, and ratings
4. Recommend with reasoning

```bash
iherb-cli search "vitamin d3" --limit 20 --sort best-selling
iherb-cli product 53330
iherb-cli product 18222
```

### Compare products

1. Get details for each product
2. Extract and compare: active ingredients, dosage per serving, servings per container, price per serving, rating, form (capsule/tablet/liquid)

```bash
iherb-cli product 53330 --section nutrition
iherb-cli product 18222 --section nutrition
```

Calculate price-per-serving: price / servings_per_container.

### Check specific product info

Use `--section` to fetch only what's needed:

```bash
iherb-cli product 61864 --section ingredients   # supplement facts + other ingredients
iherb-cli product 61864 --section nutrition      # supplement facts table only
iherb-cli product 61864 --section reviews        # rating breakdown
```

Note: `--section ingredients` returns both the supplement facts (active ingredients with amounts) and the other/inactive ingredients — everything you need in one call.

### Find budget options

```bash
iherb-cli search "magnesium glycinate" --sort price-asc --limit 20
```

Then verify quality by checking ingredients and ratings on the cheapest options.

### Localized pricing

```bash
iherb-cli search "omega 3" --country ch --currency CHF
iherb-cli product 61864 --country de --currency EUR
```

## Tips

- Search queries work best with specific supplement names (e.g., "magnesium glycinate" not just "magnesium")
- Always check the supplement facts table when comparing — brand marketing can be misleading
- Review count matters as much as rating — 4.5 stars with 10,000 reviews is more reliable than 5.0 with 12
- When recommending, mention form (capsule, tablet, powder, liquid), dosage, servings per container, and price per serving
- First run downloads a browser binary — warn the user it may take a moment
